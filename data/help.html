             <p> Travel through the continent of Europe and see the sights in this enthralling family board game.

				There are place cards for 180 different European cities from Paris to Prague, Moscow to Madrid. Each traveller 
				receives place cards for nine of these cities and he must visit all of them on his journey. The cities are different for 
				each traveller and different each time the game is played.

				Many of the place cards carry instructions, and these should be carefully considered during the all-important route planning.

				Skill and judgement are needed to decide the quickest way to travel -- overland, by sea or by air.

				The first traveler to complete his journey and return home wins the game. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HangMan_game">Wikipedia</a>
